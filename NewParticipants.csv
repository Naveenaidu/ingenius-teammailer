"EXCALIBUR","Vishnu","vishnut2000@gmail.com","Storage usage is crucial in all instances of data handling. This is where compression helps. With efficient lossless compression algorithms, storage requirements can be reduced significantly. We aim to achieve just this by improving the efficiency of a few existing lossless compression algorithms ( like Arithmetic coding, Huffman coding and the like ) using a variant of neural networks. The language of our choice will be Python. A few libraries that we'll be using are tensorflow, Keras and distiller.Implementation of Neural Networks with C++ is no trivial task, but significantly faster. We intend to use Python and a few libraries to reduce the general difficulty, whilst increasing readability."
"Error_101","Shravan","vshravankrishna44@gmail.com","We will be developing a application that help the customer and the transportation service department of any private institute to better manage their routes and pickup points. In any private transport department, the communication between the bus driver and the passenger will not always be clear. The driver might come early to a stop or be late to one depending on the previous pickups or sometimes he might want to know which stop to skip so that he arrives at the destination in time. Thus, our application aims to address this problem.
     Our application will sent a notification to the passenger when the bus is at the previous stop which will mention the ETA to his stop. This will help him to arrive at his stop in time. The passenger will also be able to tell if he will be coming to the stop or not, so that the driver can skip a stop to save time. Our app will show the best route to the driver and inform him which stops he will have to stop at and the fastest route to the stops.
     We will be developing our application with the help of Android Studio. For the traffic estimation we will be taking help from Google Maps. Our Future goal is to also tie up with public transportation."
