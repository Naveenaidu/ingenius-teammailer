These cuisines are the choices the user needs to choose from.It will check if there are dishes that can be fully cooked with available ingredients.If there is no perfect match it will find a recipie with least number of missing ingredients.User does not  have to google for the recepies , go through 100â€°Ã›Âªs of  recipies  and find the perfect dish.Provides user  with a detailed walkthrough on how to cook the dish that he might have never made before.Makes it user-friendly to cook even for newbies.(or new to cooking)"11ashomashi,Sahana,sahanar1999@gmail.com,"Our aim of the project is to charge the gadgets wirelessly (that is from distance),  not only mobiles and laptops but also any gadgets which run with power supply or battery can be powered wirelessly. We are using the concept of resonant induction. The system involves passive elements. We are also building and using resonator. Basically the charging happens with the generated magnetic field.  If the gadget is in the vicinity of magnetic field it gets charged. We will be building and using repeater to increase the distance of the field. Repeater which we will be using is thin and flexible so it can fit anywhere easily. So by using this concept, many gadgets can be powered at the same time and in any place.Since we are using magnetic fields, it is very safe biologically and also it has 98% efficiency and works over a distance. It is very helpful in defense system and it has got many applications in medical field too. It also works under the water. We can also use this concept to share the charge between gadgets. We team 11ashomashi are coming with the idea of powering gadgets wirelessly. "maze-rangers,mutturaj harage,mutturajharage@gmail.com,"Natural language processing (NLP) on androidNLP is the ability of a machine to understand human language. It is a component of AI that helps machines to understand unstructured data such as free-text or human-voice. Traditionally to communicate with computers or any devices we need programming languages, involved with logic and architectures but through NLP making it possible for anybody to interact with devices through just speaking or with simple texts can be done successfully.So we thought of an idea which encounters this need and make use of certain machine learning application concepts. It can be implemented on mobile devices for ease of use. This would be beneficial mainly for villagers and the new language learners. Recently even business are analyzing the natural human language data, to extract contains and emotions from a personâ€°Ã›Âªs voice or text and many more. In Health care NLP has much application making it easy for clinical analysis like documentation improvement, prediction or suggestion based on experience of treatment. Video summarization, question-answers trail are some of the successful applications of NLP.Objective type answers are easily evaluated by using the devices or trending technology and it takes less time to do so but for the evaluation of subjective type answers we still relay on the methods of evaluating it by a faculty, it not only consumes more time but also there are possibility for missing evaluation of any answers and generation of report is a tedious work but through NLP making this task less tedious and easy for teachers is possible, processor can recognize the answers and evaluate it accordingly; with the scheme of evaluation and generate report based on this. The report generated can be sent to student or parents directly. For these machines have to understand the way we interact, including the language or human voice which is not always precise and is ambiguous it also includes usage of abbreviations, slang, homophones and such. Working for better performance and efficiency is challenging.  "T3chnocrats,Praneeth Sebastian,praneethsf25@gmail.com,"Retailers often emphasize on the need for superior sales forecasting techniques to avoid stock outs, overstock and to maximize growth. We as a team plan to develop our project that helps in predicting sales in an efficient way and also to automate the process of placing an order when the demand for an item increases or is on the verge of going out of stock.The major goal of our project is to give to the user an estimate of the expected sale of a particular product in a given store in the weeks or months to come. The user interacts with a web application that gives a statistical representation of the outcomes. The prediction is achieved by using scikit-learnâ€°Ã›Âªs multivariate linear regression model. The model works on a data-set that consists of various parameters of a product, target being the number of items sold.On the basis of the predictions, our model works on a database that contains the total stock that is available. If the demand for an item is high and the stock is less then the model automatically places an order with the appropriate quantity of stock to meet the requirements. We make use of a neural network to achieve this.Some of the tools we intend to use are as followsTensorFlow to develop the neural networkPandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter NotebookDjango for the backend and HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT for the frontend, Mysql as database"Hello World!,Rishu,rishurv97@gmail.com,"Our idea for hackathon is related to farmers. most of the time farmers don't get the deserving cost of the crops they sell in wholesale market. nowadays as everyone has smartphone our application enables farmers to sell their crop directly to the retailer at the cost they want to. They can directly contact the retailer and skip all the intermediate wholesalers who take a lot of commission.Our app will also notify farmers about the seminars that are held near their village so that they can get aware of the scientific ways of farming to get maximum yield of their farm."The philics,Sidharth ,sidsunil7@gmail.com,"Our team,  the philics,  has come up with an idea for a smart conservation water tank. With our knowledge in hardware and software,  we plan on designing a water tank that checks the impurity level and pH level of the water and control the water pH level by intake of selective water pH.  Additionally,  we will add a feature that constantly monitors the water level and if the water level reduces beyond a limit,  it turns on the motors that refills it and when the water level increase above a limit,  it turns on motors that reduce the water level by sending the excess water for watering plants etc. We will develop an app that will be able to communicate with the tank and display the details mentioned above through Bluetooth/ WiFi. Overall, we plan on creating an efficient and inexpensive water management system that takes care of our cost and our health.

It ranks the drivers based on 'safe drives' keeping into consideration various parameters which is determined by  sensors and cameras positioned at appropriate places in a cab.These sensors and cameras record rash driving(based on speed), red signal jump, accident made by the driver during customer ride,pattern of sleep (if the driver continues to close his eyes even if a couple of warnings are given), and the records of health issues the driver possesses.These parameters get recorded and is used to rank the driver based on 'safe driving'. As more of these parameters are recorded with respect to a driver he would be ranked as 'less safe to drive ' respectively. During the cab booking , the customer gets the 'safe drive list' of the drivers from where they can choose the driver for their ride among the possible first rated 'safe drives' drivers.This would ensure a safe drive to the customers with accurate results of the driver examined under various parameters as opposed to the customer feedback which might not always be right. This ensures safety of  the customers during the cab drive."Late_Beginers,Sirisha,sirioct24@gmail.com,"Standing in long queues for hours together to obtain the student â€°Ã›ÃèBMTC bus passâ€°Ã›Âù or â€°Ã›Ãèyearly passâ€°Ã›Âù  has added to the  misery of students every year.To end this we propose to exploit features of database,fastest search and sort algorithms to store required information.The process is automated from filling application to uploading  necessary documents online.
