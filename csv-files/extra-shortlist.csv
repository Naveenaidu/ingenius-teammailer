Hack O‰Ûª Holics,Aravindhan,varavindhan2010@gmail.com,"Keywords :- OpenCV, Keras, Android Studio, ThingSpeak, Arduino, Multi-variate ClassificationEvery year many farmers face loss of 20-30% every year due to various factors. Some of these factors are plant diseases, pets, bad weather and poor soil conditions. Team Hack O' Holics looks to detect pest attacks or plant diseases in real-time using computer vision. We will also analyse the climatic and soil conditions by using cost-effective sensors. These sensors include a temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor and certain chemical sensors to measure the soil's nutrients. These values will be uploaded onto an IoT cloud from which our Android application will display these values. A classification model would be applied to the temperature data to predict rain in the area. The app would notify the farmer when these values deviate from the desired values. These notifications would help the farmers minimise or even prevent the losses they would have to suffer and could also bring the crop prices down saving a lot of money for the end consumers. "
Tech Naagins,Shaurya ,shaurya.soni@gmail.com,"APPLICATION INTEGRATED SMART DOOR LOCKA smart lock is a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled device that allows users to lock and  unlock a door by sending secure signals from a mobile application on your smartphone.Smart locks provide a new home security experience with the ability to customize who can access your home and when,lock or unlock your door from anywhere with your smartphone.FEATURES-Wi-Fi connectivity-allows you to view entry and exit logs in real time so that you know who has come and left your home and when.Bluetooth connectivity-allows your smart lock to recognize you by connecting with your smartphone and unlock the door as you approach.Auto- locking option-Let you set your smartphone to automatically lock the door if left open for a specific amount of time.Perimeter auto-locking-Can automatically lock your door if your smart phone's location is detected outside of a designated perimeter from your home.We'll be using Biometric and Face recognization for verification in case someone else got access to your smartphone.COMPONENTS USED-1)Raspberry pi 3 Model B2)High Torque servo ,MG995R3)Jumper wires 4)Micro computer5)Mini Push Button6)LED Light7)Sensors"
Deus Ex Machina,Harshitha,harshitha.4199@gmail.com,"There are a wide range of skin disorders that affect us, from ones that are short-lived and insignificant to others that could have life-threatening implications. Diagnosing skin disorders often tends to be an expensive, time-consuming process. In countries like India, there is a shortage of well-trained dermatologists and diagnostic technologies.Our software aims to help a layman effectively diagnose a skin anomaly. Our solution intends to employ the popular Machine Learning-Image Processing library TENSERFLOW. Our software will be trained with a large number of datasets of images of a range of preexisting skin disorders on different skin tones. This will train the software to effectively cluster and classify images into different categories. We also want to localize disease features given an input image. After adequate training, the software will be able to accept an image of a skin anomaly that needs to be diagnosed. The training that it has undergone will enable it to appropriately categorize the image to the class of disorder that it belongs to.The tools and methods used are: Tenserflow, python language and libraries, Tensorflow Object Detection API(for localizing features), Inception v3(feature extraction and classification purposes), convolutional neural network(CNN) methods and other algorithms."
Daughter and Sons of Khaleesi,Srishti ,srishtivermachamp@gmail.com,"Nowadays people use mobile phones and other mobile devices. Most of us have a small computing device that is always with us. People use it example for calling, as calendar and organizer. Mobile devices with GPS receiver are also used to find paths in navigation. The main idea of this thesis was to design a system that will run on most of phones and palms and will be helpful when visiting some new places and cities. This system should be able to find a route using user criteria. Those criteria should be simple and natural, like for example: a list of museums, the most famous historical objects, restaurants to visit, constraints to travel by bus and by walking. The system should find a path that fulfills those criteria, show it on screen, show names of objects, some short descriptions and photos of them and possible entrance costs. It should also be able to estimate time needed to travel from one object to the next and if it is possible, advise which bus line or other public means of transport may be used. It should be helpful for people that want to visit a city without having much information about it. Paths that are output of this system are only a proposition for trip."
Gray Matters,Niveditha,reddynivedithap@gmail.com,"""Oh! I forgot"" is a very common clause that we use which is taken casually . But for people with Alzehmeir it's not so, it's quite a serious problem for them.As the disease advances, symptoms include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings,behavioral issues, dificult   with self-care. We are building an app that will keep track of day-to-day routine,reminding them about taking medication or appointments.If the user has no memory of the person he meets,this app helps him give description of the person by stating the relationships and also lets him go through all the memories he has ever had by making a short clippings of the photos available in the mobile.Loneliness is another major issue leading to depression in senior citizens,they get to spend less or no time with their children.This app identifies when the user is feeling lonely by interacting every now and then and analysing the responses.The necessary reports of the user's behavior and routines tracked is sent to the caretakers,doctors.In case the person is lost,it guides him back home along with sending the caretaker the location of the user."
