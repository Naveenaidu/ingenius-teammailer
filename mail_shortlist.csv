They also remove the sim. We look to tackle this problem, prevent such thefts from happening and try to track our phone, and also give a tough time for the thiefs.We will develop a mobile app which will help us achieve the objectives. The app will do the following things:1)Disable switching off of phone without password2)Activate phone location, data, camera and other settings helping us to connect to the mobile by sending a text message.3)Use bluetooth to help track the mobile.4)To allow secure removal of sim tray only after entry of PIN or password. 5)Copy the data in the mobile phone to a specified location and then destroy the data in the phone. This will help us recover and protect sensitive data. An app with these features will reduce the number of mobile thefts as it makes it difficult for the thieves  to escape. Disabling connectivity of the mobile is one of the main problems. Protecting these settings with password leaves the thief with very few options. Combining this with a tracking feature using a friendâ€°Ã›Âªs mobile makes it easy to catch the thief, if the loss is realized soon enough.We will be using android studio for app dev. We will prepare the layouts for the app,finish  connecting mobiles and tracking using location prior to the hackathon. On the day of hackathon, we will put everything together and demonstrate."Strawhats,Tejus,dtejus80@gmail.com,"There are a lot of instances where one loses there dear ones due to unforeseen incidents.Everyday when we walk out of the house we have the fear of getting hit by these fast moving vehicles.

Blockchain technology offers us the opportunity to take control over the circulation of our personal data. The data stored on the blockchain is not stored in one host but is with all the nodes/computers in the chain. Its impossible to change the data once its on the Blockchain.Our idea empowers consumers to restrict sharing of their identity with only trusted local or remote entities. DLT(Distributed Ledger Technology)-based digital identity works on the public key cryptography principle, where every identity is a â€°Ã›Ã·key pairâ€°Ã›Âª consisting of a public key used to send data to an address and a private key to read data4 . For example, a customer shares her digital identity/know your customer (KYC) documents with a DLT-enabled financial institution to authenticate herself and qualify her digital identity on the DLT platform. The institution can then share customersâ€°Ã›Âª data with other entities for legitimate purposes, only after receiving the customerâ€°Ã›Âªs consent. This facility benefits all parties in saving time and money by eliminating the need for KYC at multiple places within or outside the country, thereby optimising costs involved in accurately establishing identities. With a single identity across the globe, it also aids regulators to monitor fraudulent activities, such as money laundering, more effectively.Our proposed solution can be used in airports too in lieu of passport. Instead of carrying a passport to airport every time you travel. You take a picture of yourself, stamp it with a public and private key, both of which are encoded to prove it is legitimate. The passport is stored on the ledger, given an address with a public IP, and confirmed by Blockchain users.Our proposed solution has some key features: 1. Transparency: The identity owner can control and restrict which 3rd trusted parties access the data to authenticate the identity 2. Accountability: Only the person who's identity is stored on the ledger is the owner of the data 3. Immutability: No one except the identity holder can make changes to the data except the party which forms the identity in the first place"Victorious Secret,Harshitha,harshitha715@gmail.com,"Since the optimal utilization of electricity and water is very much needed in this generation, we have decided to come up with a project called the smart energy meter.The energy meter in our homes can be made digitalized so that the users can track their monthly usage of these resources.

To keep the network running safe and secure monitoring the end point of the network is the most efficient way to achieve it, which allows the organization to figure out the performance, the issues or the problems and the flow of information over its network. consider it to be, from where the traffic is at its highest, from where the data breach took place, monitoring which device uses the most bandwidth and is connected to the other computers outside the network. Most of the organizations find it difficult to control the employee's usage of the network within the limited premises because when employees visit websites through the organization's network, not only the employee's device(end-point) is at risk but the whole organization's network will be compromised. So, it is not only important to secure the organization's network but also its endpoints over the network. A GUI based Network Monitoring System is proposed which provides graphical representation of the devices connected to the network,its usages of the network traffic such as servers to which the device is connected, its total duration, total bytes sent and received which in turn helps the organization to monitor and to have the control of the endpoints of its network. There are many open source tools to do this but our idea stands unique among them by providing a graphical representation of the network monitoring and makes it easy for the organization to monitor its own network and also helps in investigating cyber threats by analyzing the endpoints which were responsible to unauthorized access to the network. python is used as programming language along with selenium module to get the data from web browser to know the server connected to the device and its usage and basic TCL scripts to create the graphical representation of devices connected over the network."Techmeout,Sanjana ,sanjkrao@gmail.com,"                                     LookLearnPost            Caption generation has always been a significantly challenging area in the field of deep learning and the uses are in multitude.

Pupil abnormalities directly or indirectly lead to loss of vision, double vision or complex syndromes depending upon the location of lesion. â€°Ã›ÃœRelative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) or Marcus gunn pupil has been one of the basic pupil abnormalities that affects the eye causing each to respond differently when a light is shone to them or when person undergoes different lighting environments. The condition of a person having marcus gunn pupil may trigger other eye problems such as visual impairment that may need to be treated immediately. Suppose a person complaining of visual impairment or other visual defects goes for treatment to a doctor, the doctor needs to determine the cause of Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_  discrepancy which can be many such as RAPD, cataract or any other non-RAPD related condition. Hence there lies a need to identify the cause of discrepancy and further to classify the classes of RAPD (No RAPD, Mild RAPD, Moderate RAPD or Severe RAPD).Ã¥Ã_We plan to make a wearable device for the patient and then, extrapolate the use of consensual light reflex (Swinging Eye Test) to detect and classify the different stages of RAPD. We detect the differences between the two eyes as how they respond when a light is flashed in one eye at a time. Since the reaction of both the pupils are linked to each other, we shone the light at one eye using a bundle of LEDs (maintained at a required intensity) and then at the other at an interval of around 3 seconds , we capture the images of both the eyes through a video or an image and then disassemble the video into different frames to further apply image processing and machine learning.To get rid of the complexities such as varying pupil and eye ball size from person to person, different time duration of dilation and relaxation, rapid blinking of eye and so on, we employ the use of ratio of expansion of pupil size before and after the light is shone at the eye. Also the image of the defected eye is then compared with that of a normal eye to extract the discrepancies. We further apply image processing concepts such as cleaning, smoothing, image thresholding, color filtering, transformations and other image operations to extract meaningful data from the obtained images. Further we plan to build and train machine learning model to classify and predict the type and stages of RAPD or any other visionary abnormalities.

Early blindness due to diabetic retinopathy is usually preventable with routine checks and effective management of the underlying diabetes.The World Health Organization estimates that 347 million people have diabetes worldwide. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with long-standing diabetes. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or averted if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process that requires a trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina.

ABSTRACT:The  inefficient  methodology  in  supervision  and  data  acquisition  of  the distribution power grid network is because of dependence on manpower and out dated  technology  right  from  distribution  sub-stations  until  the  consumer  end. Real time data acquisition, monitoring, controlling of the grid components and automating   the   entire   system is our main focus. Theft or unregulated connections which cause huge losses are  taken care of in our system, with timely and efficient way of service maintenance of the grid. The proposed model focuses on detection of faulty locations and anti theft which would reduce such discrepancies to greater extent.II.FAULT LOCATION: Proposed model helps the base station detect the approximate GPS coordinates of fault location. The fault usually occurs between the two electric poles; in such a case the power to the respective connections gets disconnected, now all the DC powered smart meters undergoing power failure sends a signal to the base station. The algorithm at the base station recognizes the fault pole GPS coordinates after analysing the signals and comparing it with the databases.Suppose the fault occurs between the pole and the few houses; the embedded units of that power disconnected connections sends that signal to the base station and automated algorithm approximates the location. The database is the pre known embedded unit electric poles and consumer locations. Any internal fault data would be sent to the userâ€°Ã›Âªs mobile through text messaging.III.ANTI THEFT: The system developed has a default preset value of units per time (highest level for non industrial purposes), if any particular power connection crosses that limit it means that there is either illegal power tapping or false industrial connection is being established.

But since we know that the data stored on the daily basis is very high whereas the storage space available is not always sufficient, people look for additional storage space like clouds in large volume. But the storage methods are not always an efficient one. Therefore, the aim of our project is to reduce the resources like external storage by a way that provides an environment which is highly reliable. This way we present a versatile and practical storage de-duplication platform. Usually when data is shared on a group, the same data is stored in a specific cloud storage of each user, by which the same file is stored multiple times, this consumes storage unnecessarily. To prevent this, we have developed â€°Ã›Ã·De-Duplicationâ€°Ã›Âª which will detect the duplicate data using hash algorithm and remove this duplicate data and give users the root data.

The main components of the system are as followsA mobile app on which the order is placed and the payment is done IoT enabled receipt generator which generates the receipt in the canteen on scanning the order and hence functioning as an extra billing counter which will help to process the order faster.IoT enabled Order Screen which shows the upcoming order (the order comes up on this screen as soon as it is scanned by the receipt generator.) and helps the chef to optimize the process of making food and hence making the whole process more efficient and fasterAt first glance, the idea of having a receipt generator might sound foolish and redundant. The user can place the order and do the payment on the app and then show the acknowledgment for the same while collecting his order.However, many a time, a lot of people show screenshots of payments done for previous order and manage to get â€°Ã›Ãèfree foodâ€°Ã›Âù, which is a  loss to the canteen. In such cases, it becomes necessary to have something tangible (like a receipt).Use case: The user orders food on the EatEasy mobile app and does the payment.Going to the canteen, he/she scans the QR code for his/her order on the EatEasy Receipt generator, which then prints the slip for his/her order, and at the same time displays the order on the EatEasy Smart Order Screen in the cooking area.The user then gets the estimated time for collecting his order from the counter. "Bits Please,Shivam,shivamis.is16@rvce.edu.in,"It has been seen that Deep Reinforcement Learning has been providing excellent results in problems where the present state of the environment is essential in directly determining what action to take next.

The glove houses an Ardiuno which runs an  interactive program to prompt the user through motions in order to gauge range of motion and detect muscle activity which can be used by the physical therapist.The ExoPAR Glove is based on technology capable of providing patients who were otherwise unable to regain use of their hand by current therapies offered by rehabilitation robots while allowing acute rehabilitation centers the ability to gain full reimbursement for their services.Executive summary: The lack of data contributes to poor success rates because  (1) reimbursements for care at rehabilitation centers is dependent upon quantifiable results, (2) the optimal intensity of training cannot be determined without specific data to quantify the patientâ€°Ã›Âªs progress, and   (3) patients lose motivation without concrete evidence that they are making progress.Solution: In response, we have created the ExoPAR Glove. This glove will meet the identified needs by   (1) facilitating the creation of quantitative reports of therapeutic progress to allow for complete reimbursements, (2) Data (muscle activity and axes readings) obtained by the device is sampled, quantified and analysed , and is used as input for the Machine learning Model which is built for this specific purpose.    (2) allowing physical therapists the ability to identify and address specific deficiencies based on the predicted results of the ML MODEL in the patientâ€°Ã›Âªs therapy, and   (3) thus providing solutions to enhance robotic rehabilitation for patients struggling to regain use of their hands. Prototype final design:* Two classes of sensors were utilized to accomplish the above mentioned purposes: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs or accelerometers) and Electromyograms (EMGs). * The accelerometers gauge the percent increase in the range of motion for the wrist as well as each individual finger.* The EMGs allow for a quantitative measurement of muscle activity so that a detailed record of the flexion and constriction strength for each finger over treatment period may be created.* The final design integrates a total of eight sensors (i.e. 7 accelerometers & 1 EMG) to a microcontroller to quantify the percentage of 180Ã¥Â¡ range of motion achieved by the fingers and monitor muscle activity via a soft wearable dry-electrode EMG integrated into a brace.* These sensors are unified within a single adjustable glove that slides over the userâ€°Ã›Âªs forearm and hand to allow ease of use.  The ML model is built using the following as the training parametersFour types of attributes of a RECOVERED PATIENTâ€°Ã›Âªs document is taken and used to train our model.These four attributes are:1.        Initial muscle activity (when paralysed).2.        Muscle activity after recovery (improved activity).3.        Type (and/or) amount of therapy used and 4.        The duration for which therapy was provided.After training the model using above data, the processed and quantified muscle activity data of the patient (currently paralysed)which is recorded through ExoPAR is given as input to the trained model and following results are predictedâ€°Ã›Â¢        Type and Amount of therapy that should be provided.â€°Ã›Â¢        Duration for which the therapy must be provided and â€°Ã›Â¢        Expected muscle activity (recovered) at the end of therapy.MAIN APPLICATION:* Allowing physical therapists the ability to identify and address specific areas and the deficiencies in patients therapy.* Enhancing the process of robotic rehabilitation solution to patients struggling to regain activity.* Can also be used as a preventive tool for recovery in case of initial or partial paralysis. SEQUENCE OF APPLICATIONS:1. Accelerometers measure the changes in the angle of each fingertip with respect to the baseline position.2. Data is collected and quantified.3. Quantified data is input to the ML model.4. Predicted results are analysed.5. Therapists use this data for enhancing concentrated rehabilitation of muscles.6.

Generally,at times we end up picking up products which are nearing the expiry date, and with this feature on an eatable, any person with a smart phone can just scan the QR CODE to know the expiry date and other information of the product. This would help the customers to pick up the right products and also the manager of the super market to replace the stock so that it's not wasted. We are making a prototype which will showcase the above idea which uses an Arduino setup, weight ,colour and more sensors and a QR CODE scanner.We are also trying to fit on sensors on the racks which are interfaced with the Arduino setup which displays the stock in each rack and also the signal will be sent of the right product if not placed in the right rack.

The compression ratio achieved by ouralgorithm is one of the best considering no data loss occurs while doing so. Due to many technicaldifficulties no one incorporates search in a file compressed multiple times. In short our algorithm could potentially change a major part of search and compression industries.Some of the problems that exists in current Compression softwares are:-1) The inability to perform search operation in a file which is compressed multiple number of times.2) A lossless compression algorithm whose compressed file size is not much bigger to the lossy compression algorithms compressed files.3) With larger data sets collected and created in IoT, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, hyper spectralimages, web crawlers and related index.4) The inability of usable bandwidth to keep up with increasing data consumption rates. Higherfrequency electromagnetic radiations are harmful for the living organisms.The solution we propose to the above problem are:-1) Better lossless data compression than anyone for even randomized data. Our algorithm could achieve record low sizes in the domain of text compression which could be used in web crawlers for faster data retrieval from the crawled pages. This would enhance search engines. This could also be used for image, video and metadata compression.2) Search in compressed space.Our algorithm could perform search in a compressed file without decompressing the much of it. This is a serious claim considering the fact that no one can do it without affecting the resulting file size (if they are using multipass compression). We can perform search in a file which has been compressed multiple times.So, in Ingenius 2018 we want to compress a text file and perform search operation using our algorithm.

The hack is going to be implemented using Scikit learn (ML lib) for implementing GBDT, Django (Python back end), HTML, CSS, JS (Front End), Sqlite3 (for storing and retrieving data), Open edX Rest APIs, Google Maps API . With the help of this machine learning app, we can take active measures to ensure the reduction of the current dropout rates that exists.  "Team HOLOGRADES,Niraj,babar.neeraj@gmail.com,"Hi!! We the members of Team HOLOGRADES aim to take technology a step ahead. We wish to present the prototype of an interactive hologram. To create the hologram we use the basic laws of reflection. Our project will emphasize in interacting with the hologram and in order to achieve that we use ultrasonic sensors, arduino and bluetooth module. Basic motion and resizing of the hologram with our fingers is what we are aiming to produce. We are going to use the values obtained from the ultrasonic sensors as the input to the app which creates the hologram. We are planning on using MIT app inventor and arduino ide.On the application side, we see application in the field of education and prototype buildings as 3D diagrams are hard to conceive and produce in 2D sheets. The interactive 3D model will help us understanding and speed up production. The future lies in VR and interactive hologram and we hope to bring Tony Stark's workshop to life with our implementation of this project."Absolutely Integrable,Ashish Kumar ,mishraashish591@gmail.com,"OVERWATCH We are designing a wrist watch which ensures women safety by sending distress SOS signal with help of a mobile app. The watch will receive a signal when the pulse/heart beat of the women goes high i.e. when she is in trouble, which is monitored by a pulse detector sensor that will be embedded in the watch and In this system, we are also using force sensitive sensor that women can put anywhere(on shoulders or back) of their wearable which will send a signal to the watch if someone tries to grope her intentionally. In any of these cases the watch will convert these signals into vibrations which will be felt by the women as danger signal. If she feels safe/if the vibration is false then she can turn it off within 10-15 seconds otherwise if not turned off it will send an alarming message to the nearest 3 contacts in her phone from her current location  and the nearest police station/patrolling party using mobile app. It will acknowledge the contacts and police about the the current location of the women by using GPS Tracker. The GPS Tracker will tell the real time position of the woman and will keep a track on her in case of kidnapping.Additional feature: The inbuilt Taser can be used by the wearer to shock the attacker. Future work: The watch will be biometric to ensure the correct person switches off the vibration and also it can work without a mobile app or if phone is switched off."We are dynamite,Vanishree,desaivani17@gmail.com,"IOT smart mirror with News and temperatureSmart mirrors are the mirrors of future.A part of the connected world where we would be able to see news, temperature, weather just while looking and grooming in front of mirror. Our system uses raspberry pi based processor board along with display and IOT based circuitry and temperature sensor interfaced together and a panel to construct the outer frame then a specialised glass with a back frame to encase the system.The frame cavity is fitted with positioned mounts for the display housing to be fitted in the mirror. Now we use raspberry pi to connect with the internet using IoT circuit through the use of the WiFi module. This allows us to recieve data through the IoT platform. We use IoTGecko to connect to the internet and get newsfeed. The temperature sensor interfaced here displays the current temperature and display it on the mirror fitted display.

To achieve this, we are creating our very own Android application using the MapBox API that is also connected via the Internet of Things to traffic signals around it such that it turns traffic signals on its way green (and others at those junctions red) as it passes through, thereby allowing them the least possible travel time, which is especially crucial in times when every minute counts. The way the ambulance that will get to the patient the quickest is chosen is by comparing all those in a four-kilometre (and if none are found, then eight-kilometre) radius and seeing which will take the least time to get there, which is a better system than the currently used least-distance system. This is done by sending these times to a simple comparison algorithm, which returns the least time, and using that as a key, the ambulance is chosen. This ambulance then receives directions to the patient. During the up-time of the ambulance (i.e., when the siren is on), both sides of the road are made available to it (and traffic suitably redirected). This allows ambulances to greatly reduce travel time when they otherwise would need to take a roundabout path. This way, we hope to reduce the number of preventable deaths that occur due to delays in bringing patients to the hospital."Where's the pizza,Rajat,rajatmishra343@gmail.com,"The existing paper-based business cards hardly contain much information and the font sizes are rather tiny, causes inconvenience to individuals who suffer from vision defects, straining their eyes while accessing the information. Along with the significant growth of usage in mobile devices, this project intended to develop a Business Card Application to provide the essential functionalities to maximize the usage of the information on the business cards.Thus, this project can bring up the basic idea of Mobile Phone AR technology and its application on a physical Business Card. Virtual 3D map is the information that display on Mobile Phone by using AR technology, while typical Business Card functions as marker which assist in marker tracking and location identifying process. Applying the AR technology in Unity integrated with Vuforia library, the application is further enhanced to retrieve the business card information using the image recognition, thus giving us access to way more information than what is provided. As an addition to this, we can also include some profession specific functionalities, for e.g. a builder  can include his construction sites and could also give out a virtual tour of the whole building  to those interested, thus making the most out of augmented reality along with virtual reality. The people could also place objects to see what the house would look like. Similarly a showroom owner could give an option to see 3D view of the whole car and also provide different colour options, thus making it easier for customers.Thus, this project increases the productivity of a normal business card.Technologies Used-â€°Ã›Â¢	Unityâ€°Ã›Â¢	Vuforia Augmented Realityâ€°Ã›Â¢	Virtual Realityâ€°Ã›Â¢	Image Processingâ€°Ã›Â¢	C#â€°Ã›Â¢	Javascript"Spark ,Srikar ,10srikad@gmail.com,"We are developing a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data.

Further many people donâ€°Ã›Âªt know the trueness of the problem, so they either neglect the message or wonâ€°Ã›Âªt take time to forward the message. If the content of the message that are neglected happen to be true forwarding the message would be of great help to the victim. So our team came up with a vision of an app that checks if the person typing the message is true and generates a web page that describes the problem. The main motive behind the creation of web page is the status of the problem can be updated once the problem is solved. If a person wants to use our app he must first provide his details, the person is confirmed by an OTP that is sent to his mobile number. We plan to include some more options that will help people in need.We are basically going to use concepts of Java, Android Studios and Web development to implement the project. We are planning that 2 of us will develop the app and other will develop the required web page and then merge the two works to complete our project.   "Rubble,Aditeya,aditeya.baral@gmail.com,"The amount of waste generated per family has increased tremendously. The main issue with the collection of waste is lack of management and an organised system. The only things we can depend upon are the garbage trucks but they are erratic and irresponsible. They donâ€°Ã›Âªt follow their routines assigned to them and have no fixed timings, thus causing garbage to pile up everywhere. To overcome this difficulty, we thought of building coordination between the people and the truck drivers. So, we have created an app â€°Ã›Ã’ â€°Ã›ÃèRubbleâ€°Ã›Âù.The app has two parts â€°Ã›Ã’ a client app (Rubble Partner) for the trucks and a customer-based app (Rubble) to track the garbage trucks. The customer can get a reliable truck at their convenient time. There are however some restrictions in booking. Each ward/block in the city will be allowed to book a truck every 6 hours and not after 20:00 hours. Prioritisation of bookings is based on sector wise last booking received instead of last customer booking. There are certain time slots allowed keeping in mind the convenience of the truck drivers. Rubble allows tracking of all the trucks within a city in real time and thus keeping the customer informed of the booking's progress and the possibility of giving garbage to a nearby truck. Users get a notifications of truck arrivals. The truck driver gets notified when he is required to pick up the garbage. Navigation makes the process quicker and faster too. After each pick up the truck driver can confirm it on their app, thus notifying the BBMP and the customers. It increases efficiency, and also keeps the truck drivers more systematically aligned to their work and lays out a definite organised plan. The app also collects statistical data and keeps them for future reference. This will provide a cleaner way to maintain records."Mad_Lads,Rajath ,rajathshetty1999@gmail.com,"With the advancement in the field of computer vision, there have been efficient and accurate techniques of identification of individuals in many different industries.

Whenever an ERV starts its journey , it periodically sends its location data to a Traffic Management Server (TMS) hosted on IBM Bluemix. The TMS also keeps a tab of the traffic signals and tracks the movement of ERV along the route. Whenever the ERV is at a particular route, TMS will send a notification to all the drivers using GPS on that route, and tell them to move to a particular side. With the help of ML  we will provide an optimal speed that ERV should move without   encountering any dead signals. So there will be a smooth and clear path for  ERV."
